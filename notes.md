# notes

- make a quick web page, related to the event somehow (maybe a pic of the audience from my phone, then upload to github, then pull in and use?)
- show via GH Pages to start showing how it's a static site host
- login to glitch, start a new express server, reshape the simple page from earlier into pug view
